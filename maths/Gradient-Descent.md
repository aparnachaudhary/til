Imagine you are standing at the top of a hill and you want to get to the bottom as quickly as possible. The best way to do this is to take the path that goes straight down the hill. However, you might not be able to see the entire path from where you are standing, so you will have to take a few steps at a time, adjusting your direction as you go.

To decide which way to go at each step, you can use something called a "gradient." The gradient is a measure of how steep the hill is at your current location. If the hill is steep, the gradient will be large, and you should take a big step down. If the hill is not very steep, the gradient will be small, and you should take a smaller step.

As you take each step, you will be using something called "gradient descent" to find the best path down the hill. You will keep following the gradient and taking small steps until you reach the bottom of the hill.

This is similar to how the gradient descent algorithm works in machine learning. It starts at a point on a curve and repeatedly moves in the direction that minimizes the curve, using the gradient to decide how big each step should be. The process continues until the algorithm reaches the minimum of the curve.

In regular gradient descent, you would use the gradient to decide which direction to go and then take a step down the hill. However, in stochastic gradient descent, you would only use a small sample of the data to decide which direction to go. This means that you will be taking steps based on a limited amount of information, and your path down the hill might not be as smooth as it would be with regular gradient descent.

However, there is an advantage to using stochastic gradient descent: it is often faster than regular gradient descent. This is because it only uses a small sample of the data at a time, which means that it can take many more steps in a shorter amount of time.

Overall, stochastic gradient descent is a way to find the minimum of a function by repeatedly taking small steps in the direction that minimizes the function, using a small sample of the data to decide which direction to go at each step.
