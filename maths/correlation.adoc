== Correlation

Degree to which two phenomenon are related to each other.

=== Correlation Coefficient

* A number ranging between -1 and 1.
* A correlation of -1 i.e. perfect negative correlation, means every change in one variable is associated with equivalent change in another variable in the opposite direction.
* A correlation of 1 i.e. perfect positive correlation, means every change in one variable is associated with equivalent change in another variable in the same direction.
* There are no units attached to correlation coefficient, which makes is easy to find the correlation between variables with different units (e.g. height vs weight)
