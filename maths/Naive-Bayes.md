Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify data into different categories.

Imagine you have a bunch of cards with different types of fruit written on them, and you want to use a computer to help you sort the cards into different piles based on the type of fruit they represent. One way to do this is to use a machine learning algorithm called Naive Bayes.

Naive Bayes works by using probability to predict which category a card belongs to based on the characteristics of the fruit written on it. For example, if a card has the word "apple" written on it, the algorithm might predict that the card belongs in the "red fruit" pile, since apples are often red. If a card has the word "banana" written on it, the algorithm might predict that the card belongs in the "yellow fruit" pile, since bananas are often yellow.

To make these predictions, Naive Bayes uses something called "features" to describe the characteristics of the fruit. In this case, the features might be the color of the fruit, the shape of the fruit, or the taste of the fruit. The algorithm uses these features to calculate the probability that a card belongs in a particular category, and then it makes its prediction based on the category with the highest probability.

Overall, Naive Bayes is a way for a computer to classify data into different categories by using probability and the characteristics of the data to make predictions.
