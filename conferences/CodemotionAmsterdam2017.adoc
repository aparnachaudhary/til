=== How to write maintainable code?

* https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code
* How much time to invest in code refactoring?
** Typically for new projects, assuming you are curating code well, no dedicated effort
** Second year of the projects - start investing 10% of team effort on code refactoring
** Increase this effort by 10% every upcoming year
* Spagetti codebase
* Lasagna Architecture - Un-necessary layering in code
* Ravioli Architecture - Microservices
* Rule of Three - code duplication

=== Microservices; 5 Things I wish I'd known

==== Monolithic issues
* Grow Fat - Codebase grows, all things slow down
* Age - Introduction of new technology becomes difficult
* Ownership - 
* Economics of Scale

* Optimize for rapid aad sustainable flow of value

==== Value of Microservices

* Small
* Independent lifecycle
* Optimize for the problem
* Replacability

==== 5 Patterns

===== Basics

A minimal Service:

* Expose a port
* Health check - 200 UP, 500 DOWN
* Stateless
* Deep Check
** Check if service fails to connect to its dependency

Code and Builds - 1 repo 1 build
Separation of config from code

===== Deployments

* Always deploy empty service to production
* Developers in control
** Artifact
** Compute
** Resources
** Ownership
** Alarms
** Configuration

===== Testing

How to trust your mock?

* Rely on Monitoring
* Stable API's
* Contract testing - for internal fast moving API's

Semantic Check:

Automated test runs against a node before it is added to LB.

===== Security

Atlassian GWT based solution

===== Operations

* Log aggregations
* Circuit Breakers
** Response times
** Back pressure
** Fallback - How to handle failures?
* Request Tracing


=== Machine Learning for Java Developers

* Neural Networks - Every pixel of the image is considered as a separate neuron
* Activation Function
* Learning Algorithm
** Pick up a training example (e.g. image)
** 


=== Clouds and Containers

==== Containers:

* Stop promoting use of openjdk:latest (promote use of right versions)
* Alternatives to Docker - Joyent Triton, CoreOS, CloudFoundry

Benefits containe brings (PODA):

* Portable
* Immutable
* Faster to build
* Lighter to distribute and run
* Availability of pre-built blocks e.g. prebuilt images
* Consistent across platforms, stages

==== Orchestration

What is Orchestration?

* Handles deployment
* Manages multiple containers
* Maintains targetted instance count - scaling

Optional aspects in Orchestration:

* Routing
* LB
* Service Registry
* Application Configuration

Cloud vs PaaS:

* Cloud Foundry (Open Source - Join effort by different companies like Pivotal, IBM, SAP, etc)

==== Supervised Learning

What is it?

* Feed dataset with features
* Predictions with continuous value - called a regression problem

* Iris dataset
* 4 features - dimensions of Iris flower



==== Unsupervised Learning

* Model makes the sense of the data
* Finding clusters in the data

==== Reinforcement Learning

* Give some points (called re-inforcements) to complete the task successfully


* Input Layer
* Output Layer - depends on the problem (classification)

=== Cisco Contiv

References:

* https://contiv.github.io/documents/tutorials/container-101.html

Notes:

* Policy based container networking
** Declarative Tags - Simpler
** Manage Groups i.s.o. single objects (faster)
* Contiv is Open Source
* Works on Virtualized and Bare metal
* Application itent (focused on inter-component communication) vs Operational intent (Security, Bandwidth)
* Supports Multi-Tenancy
* Network Isolation
* Traffic Prioritization
* Leverages NIC
* Supports Microservices
* Native support for Clustering
* Certified by Docker
* Certified with OpenShift
* Full integration with Switches
* Integrates with LDAP

Q&A:
* Mesos with HA Proxy - How does Contiv help?
