Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of machine learning model that are used to process sequential data, such as text or time series data.

Imagine you have a bunch of cards with words written on them, and you want to use a computer to help you understand the meaning of the words and how they are related to each other. One way to do this is to use a recurrent neural network (RNN).

An RNN works by taking one card at a time and using it to update its understanding of the words and their meanings. It does this by looking at the word on the card and comparing it to the words it has seen before. If the word is similar to a word that the RNN has seen before, it will use that information to update its understanding of the word. If the word is new, the RNN will add it to its list of words and try to understand its meaning based on the context in which it appears.

This process of using information from the past to understand the present is what makes RNNs good at understanding sequential data. They are often used in natural language processing and speech recognition to help computers understand the meaning of words and sentences.

Overall, RNNs are a way for computers to understand and process sequential data by using information from the past to understand the present.
